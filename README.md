# House Price Predicting Model (using Linear Regression)

This is my  Machine Learning assignment for Predicting Housing Prices using *linear regression*, based on the California Housing Prices dataset available on Kaggle.  

## About the Assignment
- The model is trained using **Sci-kit tools**.
- It trains on data for housing prices to predict the housing prices in a certain area based on the dataset.
- It then checks the prediction model on test data to check the accuracy of the prediction.

## Files
- **.ipynb** â†’ it's done in Google Colab.

## How It Works
1. Load the Kaggle dataset using pandas.
2. Perform pre-processing wherever necessary in the data. Split the dataset for training and testing data.
3. Train the model on training data.
4. Perform Regularisation on the data. Implement Linear Regression.
5. Test the model on test data, and measure accuracy for both training and testing data.
6. Plot necessary graphs for the data. 
7. Predict from particular points in test data.
8. Plot result graphs for accuracy and other measures.
